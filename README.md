<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<h2 align="center">About the Project</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="img/grid_image.png" height=400 width=900/></p>

There are a lot of README templates out there on GitHub, but however, most of them didn't align with my needs and so I created this personalized one. My intention was to create  README.md template that you'll be able to use in most of your repositories with minimal modifications.  

Here's why it's so awesome:  

* You should focus on creating something amazing instead of worrying about a README.md that you might need to build from scratch.üòÅ  
* It's a template repository, so essentially you can just generate a README.md for your repository without problems.‚úÖ  
* You shouldn't repeat the process of building a README.md again and again from scratch because you're awesome.üññ  

**Of course I encourage you to make modifications to the README.md to suit your own projects but that's what its supposed to be all about. You may also suggest changes by forking this repository and creating a pull request or opening an issue.**  

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
